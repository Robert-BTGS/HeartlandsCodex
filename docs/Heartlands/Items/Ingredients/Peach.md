# Peach

Beneath that soft exterior lies flesh that drips with sweetness, fragrant and lush, carrying the magic of ripeness at its peak. Herbalists speak of the peach as a fruit of the heart—it soothes anger, softens sorrow, and awakens gentle longing, as if each bite were a memory of something half‑remembered but dear.
