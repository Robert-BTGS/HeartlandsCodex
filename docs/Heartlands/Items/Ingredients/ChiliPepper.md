# Chili Pepper

Within each pepper lies a concentrated spark of elemental heat, sought by alchemists who wish to stir the blood, sharpen the senses, or set courage ablaze. Fresh peppers, when crushed, release a searing essence that can be brewed into draughts of vigor, granting the drinker speed and relentless stamina. Dried peppers, ground into a fine powder, are a common additive in potions meant to ward off frostbite or rouse those weakened by magical cold.
