Its petals hold the stubborn joy of late summer, standing tall against wind and weather, and its magic is one of enduranceâ€”of bonds kept alive across distance and time. To those who know the language of flowers, zinnia speaks of remembrance, loyalty, and the quiet promise that absence does not mean forgetting.
