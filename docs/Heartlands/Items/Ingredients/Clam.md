# Clam

 Dwelling in the cool sands of shorelines and shallow coves, they draw in the energy of the ocean’s ebb and flow, imbuing them with subtle but potent enchantment. In potioncraft, clam meat is valued for its restorative properties, believed to mend fatigue and replenish magical reserves drained by spellwork. The broth made from their shells carries a grounding energy, often used in brews to steady a wandering spirit or anchor a traveler’s soul when passing through the realm of dreams.
