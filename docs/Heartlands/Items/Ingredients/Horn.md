# Horn

A relic shrouded in speculation, its origin lost to time and rumor. Smooth in some places and jagged in others, it curves with an unnatural elegance, as if shaped by more than bone and sinew—its surface bearing faint, shifting patterns that seem to change under different light. When touched, it carries a subtle thrum, as though some fragment of its owner’s life still lingers within.

Alchemists approach such a horn with caution, for its magic is unpredictable. Ground to powder, it may strengthen potions of protection or ignite destructive spells with sudden force; whole, it can serve as a powerful conduit, amplifying the will of the one who wields it.
