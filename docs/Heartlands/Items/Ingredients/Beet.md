# Beet

Steeped in the lore of healers and hedge‑witches, beets are prized for their grounding magic, drawing strength from the soil to restore vitality and bolster endurance. Their juice, rich and sweet, is often brewed into heart‑fortifying tonics, while roasted beet flesh is used in remedies to purge toxins and replenish blood.
