# Banana

 In alchemy, ripe bananas are valued for their ability to restore stamina, ease exhaustion, and lift the spirit, making them a common ingredient in recovery tonics and travel rations for long journeys. Unripe green bananas, firmer and more astringent, are favored in brews that fortify the body against illness and increase resilience to curses of weakness.

Folklore warns of rotten bananas, their mottled black skins hiding a bitter flesh that saps strength and spreads creeping fatigue to any who consume them.
