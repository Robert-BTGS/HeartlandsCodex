# Bread

 Freshly baked loaves, still warm and fragrant, can be infused with healing herbs and enchanted grains to carry restorative magic, turning each bite into a remedy for weariness and minor wounds. Stale bread, when dried and ground, is used as a binding agent in potions and poultices, helping disparate magical ingredients meld into harmony. Sharing bread with a stranger creates an unbreakable bond of hospitality, a magic said to protect both host and guest from harm for a single night.
