# Canteloupe

When chilled under moonlight, cantaloupe slices take on subtle restorative magic, soothing fevers and calming restless minds. The seeds, when dried and ground, are believed to enhance vitality and sharpen the senses, making them a valued addition to warriorâ€™s tonics. Its sweet juice is prized for restoring energy, lifting fatigue, and mending the spirit after long journeys or bouts of illness.
