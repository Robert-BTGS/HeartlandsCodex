# Anemone

Delicate, cup-shaped blooms that sway in the gentle breeze, as if whispering secrets to the wind. Their petals, which can range from snowy white to deep crimson, are said to close in sorrow on days of mourning and open wide under the first rays of dawn. 

Alchemists value anemones for their connections to the fleeting nature of life- they are often steeped into potions of protection, renewal and safe passage through dangerous journeys. 

In folklore, white anemones are offered to soothe restless spirits, while red varieties often hold the power to ward off misfortune and betrayal. The rare midnight anemone, with petals the color of a moonless sky, is rumored to grant visions of the past and future when brewed into a starlight infused draught.
