# Cucumber

Cucumbers carry the cool, clean taste of rainwater and shaded gardens, their smooth green skins hiding flesh as crisp as morning frost. Alchemists favor them for their gentle, restorative natureâ€”thin slices floated in a tonic can draw heat from a fevered brow, soothe a restless mind, or refresh a traveler wearied by the road. In more complex brews, cucumber juice is blended with mint or moonwater to cleanse the body of lingering curses or restore clarity after enchantment.
