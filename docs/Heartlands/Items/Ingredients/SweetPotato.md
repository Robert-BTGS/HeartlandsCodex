# Sweet Potato

 The earthâ€™s hidden ember, a root that swells slowly beneath the soil, drawing in the golden light of autumn until its flesh glows deep orange. Its flavor is rich and comforting, with a natural sweetness that speaks of hearthfires, harvest feasts, and the promise of warmth in the cold months ahead. Healers and cooks alike cherish it as a restorer of strength, its magic feeding both body and spirit with slow, steady vigor.
