# Dafodil

 Fresh petals steeped in warm honeywater create a draught that lifts sorrow, clears lingering winter weariness, and inspires creativity. Their bulbs, carefully prepared, are said to hold subtle protective magicâ€”able to ward away illness, melancholy, and certain fae enchantments when powdered and carried in a charm pouch.

In countryside lore, daffodils planted near a home are a promise of good fortune for the coming year, but cutting the first bloom before sunrise is thought to invite bad luck.
