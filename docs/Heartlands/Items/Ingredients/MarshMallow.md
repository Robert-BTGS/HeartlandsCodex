# Marsh Mallow

Its roots are thick and pale, holding a sweet, mucilaginous sap that herbalists call “the gentle healer.” This sap is said to carry the cool patience of the waters it drinks, easing heat and inflammation in both body and spirit. The plant’s magic is subtle but enduring, weaving comfort and restoration into those who take it.

In ancient village lore, marsh mallow root was steeped into teas for travelers returning from long journeys, to wash away the weariness of the road.
