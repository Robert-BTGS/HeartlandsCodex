# Apple
Apples are among the most storied fruits in herbal lore. Their crisp flesh and sweet fragrance hide a wealth of magical potential.

Red Apples, shaded as warmly as the autumn sun, are prized for vitality tonics and love elixirs. Passion and love are stirred, strengthening the bond between companions. Green Apples, tart and sharp are used in brews that sharpen the senses. They often fortify courage and can dispel most illusions. Golden skinned apples are imbued with the magic of sunlight- when distilled into a potion, they can restore strength to te weary, heal greivous wounds, or extend life itself. Brown rotten apples, though shunned by common folk, are treasured by necromancers and shadow-sorcerers; their decaying flesh holds the essence of entropy, lending power to curses, blight spells, and potions that drain vitality. 

Alchemists warn: An apple plucked under a new moon may carry a hidden curse, twisting its magic into something more perilous.
