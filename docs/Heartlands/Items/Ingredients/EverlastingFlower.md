# Everlasting Flower

Everlasting Flowers are blossoms that never wilt, their colors remaining as vivid as the day they bloomed no matter the passing years. Their petals are dry to the touch yet retain a subtle fragrance, as if infused with the memory of a spring breeze. In potioncraft, they are revered for their connection to endurance and preservationâ€”when steeped into an infusion, they can halt the decay of perishable ingredients, prolong the effects of certain spells, or grant the drinker resistance to aging magic.
