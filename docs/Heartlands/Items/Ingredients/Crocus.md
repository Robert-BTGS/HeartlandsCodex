# Crocus

Crocus flowers are among the first blooms to push through the last snows of winter, their slender petals unfolding in shades of gold, violet, and pure white. In potioncraft, they are cherished for their association with renewal, hope, and the stirring of dormant magic. The petals, when steeped, yield a delicate infusion that lifts fatigue, mends the spirit, and inspires clarity of thought. Saffron, drawn from the crimson stigmas of certain crocus varieties, is one of the most prized and costly alchemical componentsâ€”its golden threads are believed to amplify the potency of any potion they touch, especially those tied to health, vitality, or illumination.
