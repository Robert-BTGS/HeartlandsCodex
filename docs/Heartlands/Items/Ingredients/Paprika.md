# Paprika

Paprika is the fire of the earth made into dust, its deep crimson grains carrying the warmth of the sun and the slow heat of drying winds. Ground from peppers ripened to the edge of sweetness, it holds a magic of awakening—bright enough to stir the senses, warm enough to kindle courage, and lingering enough to keep the spirit steady long after the first spark. When cast into a brew or sprinkled over a dish, its flavor doesn’t simply season—it summons vigor and focus, as though calling the blood to attention.
