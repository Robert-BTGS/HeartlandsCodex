# Algae

Quiet weavers of magic beneath still waters, forming soft, drifting carpets in lakes, rivers and enchanted pools. When harvested at dawn, algae retain the faint glow of the morning star, making them a prized base for healing tonics and stamina restoring draughts. In darker arts, blackened algae from cursed swamps are brewed into murky elixers that cloud the mind or bind the will. 

Alchemists must take care, for improperly dried algae can sour a potion, turning its magic unstable- sometimes explosively so.
