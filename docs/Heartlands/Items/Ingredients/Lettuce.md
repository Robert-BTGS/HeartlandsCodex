# Lettuce

Soft to the touch and mild in taste, it is a plant of calm and renewal, favored in both kitchens and apothecaries for its gentle, steadying nature. Within its folds, herbalists say, are the dreams of the soil—slow and green, meant to soothe the restless heart.

Among healers, lettuce is steeped into mild draughts that ease sleeplessness and calm frayed tempers, while in field‑magic it is used as a charm to encourage peace between disputing parties.
