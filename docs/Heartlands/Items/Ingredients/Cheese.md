# Cheese

Cheese is the patient work of time and transformation, milk reborn through the quiet magic of aging and care. From soft, fresh curds to wheels aged until they crumble like ancient stone, each variety carries its own enchantment. In potioncraft, cheese serves as both a sustainer and a subtle amplifier—mild, creamy cheeses soothe the spirit and mend fatigue, while sharp, aged varieties sharpen wit and quicken reflexes. Blue‑veined cheeses, touched by deliberate molds, are valued for potions that strengthen resistance to disease and corruption.
