# Feather

Feathers are the wind’s handwriting, each one shaped by the journeys of the creature it once carried. Light as breath yet strong enough to ride the storms, they are treasured by potion‑makers for their ability to hold traces of movement, speed, and freedom. When infused into a brew, a feather can grant swiftness of step, sure‑footed landings, or the uncanny instinct to move with the air instead of against it.
