# Cinnamon

Its aroma can soothe the heart, still troubled thoughts, and kindle a quiet joy. Ground cinnamon is often added to restorative tonics, its heat awakening the body’s natural vigor, while sticks steeped in wine or tea lend strength to charms of love and loyalty. The trees grow only in climates blessed by both abundant rain and golden light, making them treasured by merchants and jealously guarded by the lands that cultivate them. In potioncraft, cinnamon is revered for its harmonizing nature—it can balance volatile ingredients, temper bitter magics, and infuse even the harshest draught with a lingering sweetness.
