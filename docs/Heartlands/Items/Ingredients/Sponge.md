# Sponge

Soft and porous when dried, it is valued not for sustenance but for its remarkable ability to hold and releaseâ€”water, oil, blood, or magic itself. In the hands of a skilled alchemist or healer, a sponge can become a vessel for potions, healing salves, or wards, its porous body releasing its stored essence only when called upon.
