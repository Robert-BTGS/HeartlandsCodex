# Fish

The flesh, when cooked into a restorative broth, can replenish strength and ease the weariness of long journeys. Scales, carefully dried and ground, are often added to elixirs meant to grant fluid motion, disguise oneâ€™s presence, or slip away from magical bindings.

Where a fish comes from determines the nature of its magic. Lake fish lend calm focus and steady endurance, river fish bring agility and quick thinking, and ocean fish carry a deep, patient strength that allows the bearer to endure hardship.
