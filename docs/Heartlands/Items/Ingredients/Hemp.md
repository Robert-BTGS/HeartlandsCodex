# Hemp

Its narrow leaves fan out like the fingers of a green hand reaching for the sun. Its fibers are strong yet supple, able to be spun into rope that has bound ships to docks, held bridges aloft, and secured charms in place for generations. Herbalists prize its seeds and oils for their gentle restorative properties, said to calm the mind, ease pain, and encourage the body’s natural healing. The plant’s earthy scent lingers in workshops and apothecaries alike, blending the worlds of craft and magic.
