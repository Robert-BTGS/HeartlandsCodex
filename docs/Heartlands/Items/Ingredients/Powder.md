# Powder

Powders are the language of the alchemist written in dustâ€”fine grains ground from root, stone, leaf, or bone, each carrying the essence of what it once was. Light enough to drift on a breath yet potent enough to change the course of a potion, powders are prized for their precision: a pinch can heal, harm, or transform in ways that whole herbs or raw materials cannot. The grinding itself is a quiet magic, releasing and concentrating the spirit of the source into a form that will wait patiently for its moment to act.
