# Oyster

Sealed in a rough, weather‑worn shell that hides a treasure shaped by tide and time. Within lies flesh brimming with the essence of the sea—briny, rich, and carrying the slow heartbeat of the deep. Some say to taste it is to drink from the memory of the ocean itself: the crash of waves, the pull of moonlight, the hush of currents in darkness. Alchemists and sea‑mages alike prize oysters not only for their nourishment but for their capacity to hold and protect magic, much like they guard the pearls born in their depths. Pearls themselves are said to be crystallized dreams of the sea.
