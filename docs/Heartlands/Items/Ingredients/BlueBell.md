# Blue Bell

 In the language of alchemy, they are symbols of gratitude, protection, and the quiet magic of renewal. When steeped into moonwater, bluebells produce a delicate infusion that calms the heart, eases sorrow, and mends frayed bonds between friends or lovers.

Their dried petals are often carried in charm pouches to ward against deceit and misfortune, while their roots, when powdered, can be blended into elixirs that strengthen memory and focus.
