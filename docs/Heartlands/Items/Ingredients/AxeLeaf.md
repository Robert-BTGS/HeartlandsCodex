# Axe Leaf

A hardy, blade-shaped plant whose stiff aserrated leaves gleam like polished steel in the sun. Axe Leaf carries the essence of battle within its fibers. When crushed, its sharp edged greenery releases a bitter, metallic scent and the resulting infusion is used in potions to sharpen reflexes, strengthen resolve and grant fleeting bursts of physical power. 

The leaves must be harvested withcare, as it can slice unprotected skin. Legends warn that a careless harvester may draw the plants ire, causing the leaves to stiffen and strike like a blade.
