# Fang

 Prized for the raw, primal power they carry, each one still holding the essence of the creature’s last kill. Ground into powder, a fang can be added to brews that grant the drinker heightened reflexes, sharpened senses, or the ferocity to fight without fear. Whole fangs, when steeped in moon‑infused oil, are said to create elixirs that strengthen bite‑based attacks or protect against venom.
