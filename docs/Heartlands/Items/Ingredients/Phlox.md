# Phlox

Blooms in clusters of star‑shaped flowers, their colors ranging from pure white to deep magenta, painting meadows and garden edges like spilled starlight. Their fragrance drifts on the breeze—light, sweet, and strangely lingering, as though carrying a message meant only for those who pause to notice. Gardeners and herbalists speak of phlox as a keeper of bonds, a bloom that strengthens friendships, heals strained ties, and protects the heart from betrayal.
