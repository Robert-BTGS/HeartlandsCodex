# Eye

Preserved in enchanted fluid, an eye is believed to hold the final image it beheld in life, a frozen fragment of sight that can be coaxed into revealing secrets. When distilled into a potion, it can grant the drinker temporary clairvoyance, the ability to see through illusions, or visions of distant places.

In darker magic, an eye may be bound to a scrying vessel, allowing the caster to watch through it as though it still lived, or to trap a victim in an unending loop of their most haunting memories
