# Fried Egg

Fried Eggs are said to hold the very light of morning within their golden centers, each yolk a small sun sealed in a ring of white. When cooked in warm butter can lift weariness as surely as a warm spring day drives away frost, while one prepared in spiced oil sharpens the mind and sets the heart racing with bold intent. When prepared with herbs or powdered minerals, fried eggs can become subtle charms for good fortune, warding away minor illness and misfortune for a dayâ€™s time
