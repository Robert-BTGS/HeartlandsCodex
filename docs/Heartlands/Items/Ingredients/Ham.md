# Ham

Meat transformed by patience—salt, smoke, and time working together to turn it into something far more enduring than the fresh cut it once was. Its deep, savory flavor carries a magic of preservation and fortitude, and travelers swear that a slice of well‑cured ham can steady the hands and keep the legs moving on the longest of roads. When simmered into a stew, it lends not just nourishment but a quiet, grounding strength that lingers long after the meal is done.
