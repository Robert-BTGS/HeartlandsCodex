# Celery

Celery grows in tall, ribbed stalks of crisp green, their sharp, clean scent cutting through the air like a fresh breeze. In potioncraft, it is prized not for sweetness but for its invigorating, cleansing natureâ€”stalks steeped in boiling water yield a bright, herbal brew that flushes away lingering toxins and banishes sluggishness from body and mind.
