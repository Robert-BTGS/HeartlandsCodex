# Bitter Crinila

 Its taste is as its name suggests—biting and unpleasant—but within that bitterness lies potent magic. In alchemy, Bitter Crinila is a valued component for potions that purge poisons, dispel lingering curses, and strengthen the body against disease.

 Folklore warns, however, that overuse can lead to Crinila Fever—a restless, fevered state accompanied by vivid, unsettling dreams.
