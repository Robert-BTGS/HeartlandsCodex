# Honey

Honey is the slow song of the meadow, gathered in secret by bees who carry the sun on their backs. Each drop is a memory—of warm petals, drifting breezes, and the hum of countless wings—woven into a golden thread that can last for centuries without fading. Sweet on the tongue and rich with hidden life, it is cherished not only for its taste but for its gift of keeping what it touches from decay, whether food, herb, or spell. Mixed into warm milk, it can quiet the mind; stirred into a draught, it can lend courage or knit the spirit back together after sorrow.
