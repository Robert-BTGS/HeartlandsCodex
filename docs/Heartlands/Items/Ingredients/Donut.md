# Donut

Donuts are golden rings or filled pastries, fried to perfection and often glazed, dusted, or coated in shimmering sugar. While beloved as a sweet indulgence, in the hands of an alchemist they become vessels for enchantments that seep into the eater with each bite. A simple sugar‑coated donut can be imbued with charms of good fortune or protection, while chocolate‑glazed varieties are favored for brews that spark boldness, passion, and creative thought. Fruit‑filled donuts, their centers bursting with vibrant flavor, are used in restorative magic to heal weariness of both body and spirit.
