# Muffin

 Warm in the hand and soft to the bite, it carries a quiet magic of comfort and restoration, able to lift the spirit as surely as it fills the stomach. Bakers say the true spell of a muffin lies not in its ingredients, but in the care with which it is madeâ€”the way it gathers warmth and generosity into every crumb.
