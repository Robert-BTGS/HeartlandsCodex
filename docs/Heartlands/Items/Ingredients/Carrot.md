# Carrot

Carrots are hardy root vegetables, their vibrant orange flesh storing the energy of the sun within the soil.Golden carrots, rarer and more potent, are said to grant bursts of speed and agility when consumed, while purple varieties bolster the bodyâ€™s resistance to toxins and magical fatigue. The greens, often overlooked, can be brewed into infusions that clear the mind and dispel minor illusions.
