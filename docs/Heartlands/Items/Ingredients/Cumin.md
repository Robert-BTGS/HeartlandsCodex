# Cumin

Cumin seeds are tiny, ridged grains the color of warm earth, carrying a sharp, smoky aroma that lingers on the air like the memory of a distant fire. In potioncraft, cumin is treasured for its grounding and focusing magicâ€”when steeped, it produces a golden infusion that steadies the nerves, sharpens the senses, and wards off distraction during delicate spellwork. Mixed into restorative broths, its flavor is said to awaken the spirit and strengthen the will, making it a favored spice for travelers and warriors preparing for long journeys.
