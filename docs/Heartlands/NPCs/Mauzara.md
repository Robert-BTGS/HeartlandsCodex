# Mauzara "Dragonheart"

**Name:** Mauzara 
**Race:** Antanian
**Title:** Red Team Trainer
**Location:** Rustfall Arena
**Factions:** Red Team 


Growing up working in the Arena, Mauzara stepped into the ring at an early age and quickly became a crowd favorite, earning the title “Dragonheart” for her unmatched skill in both offense and defense. Now retired from the Arena, she imparts her battle wisdom to the Red Team. Gruff but fair, she pushed her fighters to their limits, ensuring they are prepared for any challenge.

## Background


While she understands the practicality of using magic, and uses several enchanted items herself, she has always been wary of spellcasters and people who rely on magic to solve their problems. 
Mauzara is a bit naive about how life is outside of the Arena and will occasionally ask the player questions about their life outside.
