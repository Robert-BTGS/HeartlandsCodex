# Endurance


- Endurance: bow damage, max health, block, heavy armor, repair, unarmored

- Grounded, as the foundations of a lord's keep. Patient in mind, resilient in body. Like the tree, you will remain, long after the animals have died.

- Time fears endurance. Trees outlast kings. Mountains ignore wars. This is the attribute of the patient, the grounded, the stubborn. When all rots to dust, what remains? Why do you continue to persist?
