# Willpower


- Willpower: mp regen, alteration, destruction, restoration, staff

- Faithful, as the moons chase the sun. Unshakeable in resolve, unwavering in belief. Like the golem, you stand strong, holding fast to those you hold dear.

- Willpower is not the ability to resist fear, but the choice to act in spite of it. In silence, in doubt, in agony, it burns steady against the winds. How do you resist forces that would influence you?
