# Strength


- Strength: Melee damage, carry capacity, Axe, Blunt, H2H, Long Blade

- Unyealding, as the winter's cold grip on the north. Powerful in build, unmatched in physical capabilities. Like the monstrous bull men, you stand strong, ready to shoulder any burden.

- To move the unmovable, to lift beyond limits, to break what was meant to last; this is Strength. Found in the backs of laborers and the hands of warriors, strength favors none, yet it can empower all. Where does your true power lie?
