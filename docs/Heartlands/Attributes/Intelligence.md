# Intelligence


- Intelligence: max mp, alchemy, enchanting, herbology, wand

- Wise, as a predator waiting for its prey. Quick to respond, with the capacity to learn. Like the spider, your mind is a web, ready to catch information when it flies by.

- Intelligence sees what others miss. It waits behind the eyes, calculating; piecing together puzzles unknown. It knows not all answers are giftsâ€”some are curses, others are weapons. What do you know that others cannot?
