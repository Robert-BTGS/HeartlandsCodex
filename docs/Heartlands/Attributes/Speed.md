# Speed


- Speed: Movement speed, light armor, marksman, short blade, sneak

- Nimble, as a child at play. Quick in response, reactive to the most sudden dangers. Like the adder, you are poised, ready to strike at a moment's notice.

- Speed is less about motion and more about momentâ€”knowing the exact moment to fade out, to close in, to act. It carries the weightless and guides the unseen to fortunes few others can access. When do you move, when do you strike?
