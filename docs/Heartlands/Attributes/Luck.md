# Luck


- Luck: affects everything slightly

- Fortunate, as a castaway finding land. Favorable in consequence, envied in wealth. Like the wyrm, you weave through chance and fate, untouched by the snares of misfortune.

- No amount of strength can force a coin to land on its edge. No amount of intellect can predict what is truly random chance. Luck is that inexplicable force, making the unlikely certain. Can you feel these threads of fate?
