# Personality


- Personality: starting disposition, success of haggling, conjuration, illusion, mercantile, speechcraft

- Relatable, like the loss of a loved one. Comfortable to be around, loved by the masses. Like the siren, your words are sweet, charming those around you.

- Charm is not artificeâ€”it is resonance. It is the beacon others find themselves drawn towards, a light to rally behind. It is presence made manifest. Who finds themselves most charmed by you?
