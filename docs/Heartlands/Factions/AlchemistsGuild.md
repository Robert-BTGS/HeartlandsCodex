# Mages Guild

Guild's Philosophy:

The Alchemists Guild is dedicated to the study and mastery of alchemy; it was created long ago by an alchemist in the search of a master elixir that would grant him immortality, it is unknown if he succeeded. 
Their goals include discovering new potions, ingredients, transmutation of materials, and history of alchemy.

Location:

The guild should be situated in the Old District, where they have access to a variety of ingredients from the market and can sell their potions to a diverse clientele.
The guildhall could be a mix of a mystical apothecary and a scholarly research institute, filled with bubbling potions, ancient books, mysterious artifacts, and rare ingredients that can only be obtained at higher ranks.
