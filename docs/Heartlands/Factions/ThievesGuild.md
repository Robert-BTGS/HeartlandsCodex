# Thieves Guild

Guild's Origin and Philosophy:

“The Shadow Hands”(Placeholder name)  were founded by a charismatic figure known as "The First Shadow." This individual was born poor but through luck and hard work climbed the ladder to become wealthy he was then wronged by the city's elite and saw the suffering of the poor that they helped cause firsthand.
The guild operates on principles akin to Robin Hood, stealing from the corrupt wealthy to aid the downtrodden. However, they are careful to maintain their mythic status to avoid direct confrontation with the city's powers.
