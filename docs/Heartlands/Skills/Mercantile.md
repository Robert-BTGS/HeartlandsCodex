# Mercantile


Commerce is your bread and butter. You know how to barter beyond just coins with kind words, a good reputation, and influence.

Commerce is more than coinâ€”it is conversation, timing, and charisma. This discipline measures worth more than gold, taking into account reputation, and influence as a currency of their own. Skilled merchants know when to speak, when to wait, and when it may be better to take a loss. Every trade is a game of advantage, and the board is ever shifting.
