# Heavy Armor


Proficiency in plates of steel and chains of iron, you feel secure in weighty armors like Dwarven, Kyanite, and the legendary Void armor.

Your armor is not merely protection, but principle. A promise to yourself, a vow to your enemies: though there may be a time when your plate crumples and your body fails, they will not see that day. They will be the waves that crash against the shoreline, and dissipate as quickly.

Armor is not merely protection, but principle. It is a promise, a symbol, an act of defiance against the chaos that would consume the world. It is standing against the tide of thousands of enemies and saying “No. You move.”

Armor is not merely protection, but principle. Each chain, each fitted piece is a promise: that your enemies will not pass. Worn properly, heavy armor becomes more than plate—it becomes a boundary between collapse and order. From Dwarven steel to Void-forged relics, these armors carry weight in both form and meaning. When thousands charge, it is the armored who remain, saying “No. You move.”
