# Blunt


Having stood the test of time, blunt weapons continue to answer most problems, even in a world of magic and blades. Clubs, maces, and warhammers are direct and reliable.

Not all carry lighting at their side. Some carry thunder. Blunt weapons are a solution, not elegant or witty, but direct: an answer to any problem that may arise. Plate crumples, bones break, and magic fizzles when the caster lays dead. The simplicity of such weapons are deceptive. The results, less so.

Not all carry lightning at their side. Some carry thunder. Blunt arms—clubs, hammers, and maces—have endured across ages not for their grace, but for their certainty. They do not slice or pierce; they crush. Plate crumples. Barricades splinter. Bones remember. Even in a world of enchantment and elegance, there remains power in the direct answer. No flourish. No riddle. Just impact.
