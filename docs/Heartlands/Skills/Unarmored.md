# Unarmored


Avoid and evade incoming blows and never be unprepared for battle in any outfit.

No plates to slow, no weight to bind. Unarmored defense is the art of readiness in any formâ€”robes, cloth, or bare skin. Survival depends on movement, instinct, and the ability to read danger before it lands. It is not the absence of armor, but the presence of discipline, where each movement circumvents what steel would absorb.
