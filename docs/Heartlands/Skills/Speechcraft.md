# Speechcraft


Words are the sword, sharp with wit. Guile is your hammer, blunt yet precise. Charm is your armor, turning foe to friend.

Speech is a weapon, wielded with poise or provocation. A master of eloquence knows that wit cuts, guile bludgeons, and charm deflects with ease. Every conversation becomes a contest of intent—subtle, shifting, and sharp. Whether soothing tempers or steering decisions, mastery lies not in volume, but in precision. Influence is not granted—it is claimed.
