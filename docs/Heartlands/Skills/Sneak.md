# Sneak


The art of going unnoticed and undetected. Disappear in crowds, meld with shadows, and catch your foes off guard.

Sneak is the discipline of becoming less thanâ€”less than ambient sound, less presence than your form would imply, less certainty than light and dark. Crowds conceal, shadows embrace, and movement becomes a whisper. It is not cowardice, but control: the art of reaching the heart of danger without ever being seen.
