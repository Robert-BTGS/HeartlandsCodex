# Staff


Use of a staff to channel the arcane takes no small measure of care and focus, and the power you will wield is unmatched.

A channel, a shield, a strike. The staff is more than a weaponâ€”it is raw magic focused into form. Used to direct arcane destruction or augment restoration, its mastery requires balance, timing, and restraint. Whether wielded in ritual or combat, the staff brings intent to chaos.
