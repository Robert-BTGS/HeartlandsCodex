# Repair


Keep the cracks in your armor and chips in your blade from sundering in battle. Perhaps you will solve the riddle of steel.

Steel bends. Leather tears. Tools wear thin with time and war alike. Repair is the discipline of undoing that entropy—of restoring edge, integrity, and purpose. It is a quiet craft, practiced beside forge fires and in leather shops, where each strike of the hammer and each stitch of thread is an act of preservation. In every reforged blade lies a story retold, a ruin reversed. The riddle of steel is not how it’s made—but how it’s maintained.
