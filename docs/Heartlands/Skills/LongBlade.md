# Long Blade


Excelling in reach and tactical control, you dominate in open spaces where your every swing brings devastating slashes.

Built for reach, rhythm, and control, long blades seek to turn the chaos of a battle into elegant choreography. With calculated arcs and extended leverage, each strike shapes the space around its wielder. Practice outweighs ferocity, and patience delivers ruin. Favored in open combat and formal duels alike, these weapons are as much declarations as they are toolsâ€”symbols of those who would gladly die by the blade.
