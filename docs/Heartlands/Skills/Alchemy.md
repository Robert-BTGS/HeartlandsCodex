How do herbs combine when boiled? What are the building blocks of this world? Alchemy is the journey to find these answers, to understand. You know the fundamental truth: that nothing is permanent.  Whether crafting poisons to curse, or potions to heal, the foundational origins of science are yours to explore and exploit as you see fit.

Nothing in this life is permanent, everything exists as a step along the endless cycle of life and death, renewal and decay. The laws of nature are immutable. But rules are made to be broken, and laws are simply rules by a different name. With mortar and flame, you test these laws, push the boundaries of nature, and bind the essence of change to your bidding.

Alchemy represents your ability to craft potent potions and putrid poisons. It relies on Intelligence, and the application of trial and error.
