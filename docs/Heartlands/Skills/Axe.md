# Axe


Whether hewing a log or splitting the head of a foe, axes will have you covered in skill and the blood of your enemies.

Forged for survival, born of labor. There is no elegance in an axe - only certainty. There is no slash of a blade, no pierce of a dagger. There is only the bite, the brutal promise of a tool wielded by expert hands. Metal rends, wood splinters; and when the labor is done, the bloodlust fades: you remain.

What does it mean to cleave? To split one thing into two—wood, bone, war, silence.

Forged for survival, born of labor. The axe is not a weapon of finesse—it is a tool of finality. Each swing carries the weight of harvest and war alike, cleaving wood and bone in twain. There is no elegance in its arc, only intention. Metal rends, wood splinters; and when the labor is done, the bloodlust fades: you remain.
