# Short Blade


Agile and quick you know how to exploit every opening in armor and form. Short swords and daggers cut deeper in your hands.

Quick, efficient, and unforgiving. Short blades turn proximity into a mistake no enemy will willingly make twice. They wedge between plate and  puncture weakened leather, striking where it will make the most impact. Daggers and short swords favor those who seek openings rather than force them. In narrow alleys or crowded skirmishes, it is not reach that wins the fightâ€”but reaction, and timing.
