# Wand


With a swish and a flick, simple sticks become implements of your will. Your power is precision, practiced to dazzle minds and scorch foes.

Grace given focus, power made precise. Simple material wrought into arcane instruments, wands refine spellcasting into a swift, exact art. Often favored by duelists, battle-mages, and ritualists alike, the wand is less about overwhelming force and more about controlâ€”striking with speed, precision, and purpose before a word is even spoken.
