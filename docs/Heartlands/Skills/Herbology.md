# Herbology


The study of plants of every variety and the ability to see and bolster the inherent magic in all botanical life.

Herbology is widely considered a preparatory science for potioncraft and reagent refinement. Proficiency enables quick treatment of wounds, foraging of curatives, and identification of toxins in the wild. Skilled herbalists are hard to come by, and indispensable to any settlement.

A study both ancient and essential, Herbology is the careful observation of the natural world’s quiet miracles. Leaves, roots, spores, and sap—each carries purpose, each holds potential. This discipline supports potioncraft and healing, offering knowledge to mend wounds, neutralize poisons, and extract the subtle magic bound within living things. In war or wilderness, skilled herbalists remain rare—and irreplaceable.
