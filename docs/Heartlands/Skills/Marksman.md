# Marksman


The heritage of hunters and trackers is swiftly carried on in your keen use of bows and arrows.

A craft passed down through hunters and rangers. Marksmanship turns distance into advantage, and multiplies the destructive potential of a skilled fighter. Each shot is a calculation, and every arrow loosed becomes a product of focus. It is a discipline of stillness before motion, of precision made powerful. Whether blackening the sky with fellow archers, or stalking prey in the forest undergrowth, a skilled marksman is dangerous to whomever, or whatever, finds themself down range.
