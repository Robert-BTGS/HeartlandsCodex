# Restoration


Restore, heal, and fortify the very essence of life and magic against any force seeking to do harm.

Where wounds tear, magic binds. Where magic falters, it steadies. Restoration is the art of preserving what enduresâ€”flesh, spirit, and arcane flow alike. The spells of this school mend bone, bolster strength, and hold back the grasping hands of death. There are those who think themselves strong, but without restoration, a stab wound is as fatal as venom.
