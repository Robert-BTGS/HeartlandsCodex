# Block


Like the stone that splits the stream, you stand against the unending flow of combat. Halt and parry attacks best with bucklers, standard, and tower shields.

There are those who would confuse defense for inaction, but they are fools. Those that strike first waste their stamina, and drain strength that can be preserved. There is no weakness in patience, that is where true strength lies.  

To resist is not to retreat. Block is the art of discipline under pressure—the moment between chaos, and control. Shields become more than barriers; they are vows sworn in silence, stances held against storms. It is a craft of timing, of patience. Where others exhaust themselves chasing momentum, you will endure. Let the world swing wildly—walls do not flinch.
