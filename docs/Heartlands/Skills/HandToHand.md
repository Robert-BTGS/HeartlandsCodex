# Hand To Hand


Whether in tavern brawls, arena pits, or monastary gardens, you've learned to eshew weapons in favor of punches and kicks.

Muscle and bone, bound together in a dance of pain and punishment. You understand that to suffer pain is to be moral, and you are stronger for it. Every fight is a chance to hone your skills and become a better version of yourself. For every nail, you are the hammer. For every gate, you are the ram.

Muscle and bone, bound together in a dance of pain and punishment. Success relies on instinct, resilience. Hand to hand combat is more ferocity than form, but there can be elegance in its brutality. It is survival through utilizing means available to you. Seeking perfection of self, rather than strength through violence.

Muscle and bone, driven by instinct, shaped through trial. Hand-to-Hand combat strips away weaponry and ornamentation, leaving only what you were born with. Whether in back-alley brawls, dueling circles, or monastic gardens, mastery lies not in what you wield, but in what you withstand. There is elegance in its brutality, a philosophy beneath each strike. For every wound, there is a lesson. For every nail, you are the hammer. For every gate, you are the ram..
