# Conjuration


Summon to your side spirits from beyond this world; be they bound to a weapon, animating the dead, or infused with the elements themselves.

A practice as ancient as the gods. To call forces from one place to another, relocate energies across space and time, these are applications of the powers of conjuration. Improper practice risks unstable feedback, or even possession. Mastery, however, offers command over ancient blades, forgotten spirits, and even long dead beasts.

To conjure is to reach into the veil—plunging headlong towards realms unseen and histories long buried. It is the discipline of binding what should not linger: ancestral spirits, elemental forms, spectral blades, or the restless dead. There are those that have misused this power, and suffered possession or worse. Yet when it is mastered, conjuration offers more than mindless spirits and soulless bodies—it offers allies where there were none, and power from a time lost to mortals.
