# Illusion


Beguile the minds and betray the senses of even the keenest folk. Perception is yours to shape.

A subtle, more practiced approach to magic. Illusion focuses on manipulating perception, emotion, and thought. There are those who see this as deception, but is that truly their own belief? Or a seed of doubt planted there by an outsider?

A practiced distortion of truth, Illusion weaves doubt into certainty, sound into silence, presence into absence. Its spells manipulate sight, thought, and emotionâ€”not through brute force, but suggestion. Often mistaken for deception, it is instead a reshaping of experience itself. Whether confusion, calm, or charm, the result is the same: what was never there now feels undeniable.
