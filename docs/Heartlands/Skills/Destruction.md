# Destruction


Harness the power of natural forces and call elemental wrath on those who stand against you. Be it scorching, shocking, or freezing storms, calamitous ruin is within your grasp.

You are the wildfire, the tempest, the rending ice. Your magic was never learned, never practiced. It was unleashed. Your body is a conduit for the calamitous forces of the world, the fuel for the blazing fire of destruction. You burn, not because you must, but because it is your nature.

A raw expression of magical power. The most volatile, pure magical energies are put to use through destruction magic. Be cautious, as the line between power and ruin is thin, and chaos is all that waits for those too eager to toe this line.

Destruction is the raw channeling of nature’s wrath made manifest through the body. It is magic. Simple, and without ornament or apology. This school speaks in surges and sears, its lessons written in cauterized scars and shattered stone. That energy is volatile by nature, and those who grasp it tread a fine line between control and ruin. You burn, not because you learned to, not because you need to… it is simply your nature.
