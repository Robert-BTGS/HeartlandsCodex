# Enchanting


Harness the power of natural forces and call elemental wrath on those who stand against you. Be it scorching, shocking, or freezing storms, calamitous ruin is within your grasp.

To enchant is to touch the divine. Shards of ancient, godly power litter the world, ready to empower those who are powerful enough to bind the essence. You know every edge can be honed, every armor buffed, and you do so with your craft. Enchanting is not a trade to be practiced - it is legacy, bound to any item deemed worthy of divine potential.

A crafting discipline reliant on stability, and no shortage of arcane power. Enchanters bind remaining essences of long forgotten gods to mundane implements, creating something more than either could accomplish alone. This is how the legacy of the gods is maintained, how their power carries on.

To enchant is to touch the divine. It is a discipline of precision and reverence, wherein remnants of gods are sealed within steel, cloth, or bone. Each enchantment is a pact between material and myth, where the mundane is reshaped to carry memory. The process demands a keen mind, and arcane force in equal measure. Through it, legacy becomes tangible, and forgotten divinity finds form once more.
