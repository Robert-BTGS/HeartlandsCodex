# Alteration


To you, matter is mutable and change is certain. Yours is the power to open locks, lighten loads, and reshape the world. What will you make of it?

Bend too far, and the rigid lattice of the world breaks. But just enough pressure, and it bends to your will. Alteration is not simply changing how things are perceived, but rather changing the way things are. It is defiance, it is power, it is standing in the midst of consistency and saying ‘No. You move.’ 

Alteration represents your skill in shaping the world around you to your liking. It relies on Willpower, as you literally bend reality to your will.

What holds the shape of a world? What laws bind weight to stone, or breath to flesh? Alteration is the refusal to accept such limits. It is not delusion, but conviction made arcane—reshaping what is, not merely how it is seen. Locks open. Burdens lift. Barriers shift. With enough will, even the most unyielding truths may be made mutable. This is not mimicry, but defiance: reality, rewritten.
