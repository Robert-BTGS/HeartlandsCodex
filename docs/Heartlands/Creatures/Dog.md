# Dog

Dogs are loyal, intelligent companions, long bonded to humankind through centuries of trust and shared purpose. From keen‑nosed beagles that track game across leagues to sturdy little pugs who guard hearth and home, each breed carries its own strengths and charm. Valued as hunters, guardians, and steadfast friends, dogs are quick to defend those they love, their courage far outstripping their size. 

In many cultures, they are seen as symbols of loyalty, protection, and unwavering devotion—companions in both peace and peril.
