# Gloomfang

Gloomfangs are twisted, predatory creatures born of shadow and bone. Their elongated, sinewy frames are topped with a natural, horned skull structure, fused seamlessly to their flesh as both head and armor. Jagged bone ridges frame their pale, glimmering eyes, while their namesake fangs—long, curved, and black‑tipped—jut from a snarling maw built to tear through hide and armor alike. Coarse, dark fur bristles along their spine, standing on end when they ready to strike. They hunt by stalking silently through moonlit forests and rocky highlands, moving with a predatory patience before unleashing a sudden, frenzied assault. Whispers in hunter’s camps tell of venom in their bite that slows the heart, leaving prey conscious but helpless as the Gloomfang drags them into the dark.
