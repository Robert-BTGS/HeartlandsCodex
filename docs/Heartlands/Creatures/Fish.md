# Fish

Fish fill rivers, lakes, and coastal waters with flickers of silver, gold, and every hue between. From small darting minnows to great river carp, they are a vital food source for countless creatures and a symbol of abundance in many cultures. Agile and quick, they evade predators with sudden bursts of speed or by vanishing into murky depths. Fishermen prize them for their meat, shimmering scales, and in rare cases, magical properties—such as the moon‑scaled trout said to glow faintly at night, or the golden riverfish believed to bring prosperity to whoever catches it.
