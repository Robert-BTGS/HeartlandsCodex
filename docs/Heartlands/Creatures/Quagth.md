# Quagth

Quagths are squat, amphibious predators with wide, tooth‑filled maws and bulbous, unblinking eyes that gleam like molten gold. Their thick, mottled blue‑green skin helps them blend into swamps and jungle undergrowth, while small curling vines sprout from their backs, masking their presence until they strike. Despite their rounded bodies, Quagths are deceptively fast, lurching forward in sudden bursts to clamp down on prey with crushing force. Known for their unsettling, gurgling laughter, they are as much ambush hunters as they are scavengers, dragging their catch into murky water to drown it before feeding.
