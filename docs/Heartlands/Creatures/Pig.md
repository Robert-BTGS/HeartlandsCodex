# Pig

Pigs are sturdy, resourceful livestock kept for their meat, hides, and remarkable ability to forage almost anywhere. With sharp noses and an unending appetite, they root through soil for roots, fungi, and scraps, thriving in both farmyards and the wild. Though often docile, a threatened or cornered pig can bite fiercely and charge with surprising strength. In rural folklore, pigs are symbols of abundance and good fortune, while some tales warn of enchanted boars that began life as ordinary swine.
