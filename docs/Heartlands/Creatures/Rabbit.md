# Rabbit

Rabbits are quick‑footed, soft‑furred herbivores found in meadows, forests, and farmlands. With their keen hearing and powerful hind legs, they can vanish into the underbrush in the blink of an eye. Though gentle by nature, rabbits are resourceful survivors, creating intricate burrow networks to evade predators. 

In folklore, they are symbols of luck, fertility, and cleverness—sometimes said to be messengers of forest spirits or shapeshifters in disguise.
