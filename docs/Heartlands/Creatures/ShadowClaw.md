# Shadow Claw

Shadow Claws are predatory wraith‑beasts born from living darkness, their sleek, panther‑like forms shifting and dissolving into shadow as they move. Their glowing, predatory eyes pierce the blackest night, and their elongated claws—razor‑sharp and dripping with shadow‑essence—can tear through armor as if it were cloth. They strike without warning, emerging from pools of darkness to maul their prey before melting back into the gloom.
