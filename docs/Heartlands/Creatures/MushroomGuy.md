# Mushroom Guy

Redcap Clubbers are stout, round‑bodied mushroom folk with bright crimson caps flecked with pale spots. Though small in stature, they are surprisingly strong, wielding heavy stone clubs with a clumsy yet brutal swing. Their thick, spongy bodies absorb blows, and their earthy scent can mask them perfectly among forest undergrowth. Redcap Clubbers are territorial and quick to anger, often gathering in small bands to drive intruders from their fungal groves.

Sporefang Creepers are hunched, menacing mushroom creatures with mottled brown caps that conceal clusters of needle‑like fungal spines. Their gnarled limbs end in sharp claws, used to grip prey while releasing clouds of toxic spores. They prefer to lie in wait, camouflaged among rotting logs and leaf litter, before ambushing anything that wanders too close. Wounds from their claws can quickly fester as invasive mycelium begins to take root in the victim’s flesh.
