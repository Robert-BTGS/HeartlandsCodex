# Boar

Boars are stocky, muscle‑bound beasts with coarse bristled hides and tusks sharp enough to pierce armor. Known for their stubborn resilience and explosive charges, they are feared both in the wild and in the arena, where their sheer strength can topple even seasoned fighters. Wild boars are fiercely territorial, defending their herds with relentless fury, while trained war‑boars are prized mounts and shock‑troop beasts. 

Among the most famous is Bacon, a loyal companion boar whose iron will and battle‑hardened tusks have saved many a warrior from certain defeat.
