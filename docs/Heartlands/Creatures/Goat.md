# Goat

Goats are hardy, sureâ€‘footed animals able to thrive on rocky slopes, grassy hillsides, and even the most unforgiving mountain terrain. Known for their curious nature and stubborn temperament, they will climb, chew, and explore nearly anything within reach. Their sharp horns and surprising agility make them capable of fending off smaller predators, and their milk, meat, and hides are valued by farmers and travelers alike. In some rural tales, goats are said to sense approaching storms or lurking danger, bleating loudly in warning long before others are aware.
