# Serpens

Serpens are lithe, serpentine predators with sleek, scaled bodies that ripple with muscle. Their piercing eyes and forked tongues constantly taste the air, allowing them to track prey with uncanny precision. Moving with fluid grace, they can coil around enemies to constrict and crush or strike with lightningâ€‘fast precision, injecting venom that paralyzes before the final kill. In ancient myths, Serpens are often depicted as guardians of hidden treasures or sacred places, their patience matched only by their lethality.
