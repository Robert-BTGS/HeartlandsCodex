# Wraith

Wraiths are malevolent spirits consumed by rage and hunger, their skeletal forms wrapped in shadow‑stained robes that seem to drink in the light around them. Their bones are darkened by centuries of corruption, and their clawed fingers are long enough to pierce both armor and soul. Unlike lesser ghosts, wraiths possess cunning and malice, stalking their prey with deliberate patience before striking. Their presence bleeds the warmth from the air, and their chilling laughter can shatter the resolve of even seasoned warriors. Legends claim a wraith’s touch can strip away fragments of a victim’s spirit, leaving behind only a hollow shell fated to join their spectral ranks.
