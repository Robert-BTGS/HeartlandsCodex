# Fungoid

Fungoids are eerie, humanoid mushroom‑creatures that thrive in the damp gloom of caves, swamps, and deep forests. Their bodies are a blend of sinewy muscle and fibrous mycelium, with caps and spore‑laden growths sprouting from their heads and limbs. Moving with slow, unsettling precision, they fight with both physical strength and the toxic weaponry of their fungal nature—releasing choking clouds of spores that blind, poison, or ensnare their prey. Some are known to plant their victims in the soil, allowing creeping roots to overtake the body until nothing remains but another Fungoid. Though often solitary, larger colonies act as a single, hive‑minded organism, defending their territory with unwavering persistence.
