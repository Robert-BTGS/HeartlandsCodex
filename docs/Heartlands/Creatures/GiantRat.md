# Giant Rat

Giant Rats are filthy, aggressive vermin grown to unnatural size, their matted fur crawling with fleas and their yellowed teeth glistening with disease. They thrive in sewers, ruins, and shadowed alleyways, feeding on refuse, carrion, and anything too slow to escape their gnawing bite. Their keen sense of smell allows them to track prey through darkness and filth alike, and their speed makes them difficult to corner. While dangerous alone, they are far deadlier in swarms, overwhelming victims in a frenzied tide of claws and teeth. In some regions, they are carriers of magical plagues, their bites festering with curses as well as infection.
