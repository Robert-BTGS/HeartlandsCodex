# Wolf

Wolves are swift, intelligent predators that hunt in coordinated packs, using keen senses of smell and hearing to track prey across vast distances. Their muscular bodies and powerful jaws make them formidable hunters, while their howls carry through the night as signals to their kin or warnings to intruders. Fiercely loyal to their pack, wolves work together to bring down prey much larger than themselves.
