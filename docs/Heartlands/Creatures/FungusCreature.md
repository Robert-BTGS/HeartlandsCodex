# Fungus Creature

Fungus Creatures are squat, cap‑topped beings born from ancient, enchanted spores. Their broad mushroom caps shield them from sun and rain, while twisted, vine‑like arms tipped with hardened claw‑growths make them surprisingly dangerous in close combat. Slow‑moving but stubbornly resilient, their spongy bodies absorb blows that would cripple other creatures. They often lurk in damp, shadowed places, feeding on rot and decay, and will defend their territory by releasing bursts of pungent spores that disorient and weaken intruders.
