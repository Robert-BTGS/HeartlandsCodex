# Vampire

Feral Vampires are skeletal, corpse‑like predators—stripped of the elegance their kind is known for, yet still dangerously quick and cunning. Their withered skin clings tightly to jutting bones, their sunken eyes glowing with a cold, predatory light. Long, jagged fangs protrude from their gaping maws, and their clawed hands can tear through flesh as easily as silk. Driven by pure hunger, they stalk in silence, striking with sudden, bone‑snapping ferocity.
