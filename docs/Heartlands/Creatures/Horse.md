# Horse

Horses are swift, powerful steeds valued for their speed, endurance, and loyalty. From sturdy workhorses pulling heavy loads to sleek chargers thundering across battlefields, they have long been trusted companions to travelers, farmers, and warriors alike. Their keen instincts and strong bonds with their riders make them dependable in both calm and chaos, carrying their masters through treacherous terrain or straight into the heart of danger. In some cultures, certain horses are believed to be touched by magicâ€”able to sense approaching storms, find safe paths in the wild, or ride tirelessly for days without rest.
