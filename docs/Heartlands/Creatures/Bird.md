# Birds
Chicken: While humble on the outside, they are keen-eyes swentinels, quick to sound their alarm at the first sign of nature. Their crests blaze crimson like a warriors helm and their sharp beaks and clawed feet  belie a surprising ferocity when defending their brood. In certain folk tales, white feathered hens are said to ward off evil spirits. 

Legends whisper of chickens that drink moonlight, laying eggs of silver or gold, guarded fiercely from theives and tricksters.
