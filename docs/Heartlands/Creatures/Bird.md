# Birds

Birds are the sky’s restless wanderers, from sparrows and finches that spread seeds and song to raptors that ride the wind with piercing eyes and razor talons. Seen as divine messengers in many cultures, they can be fierce defenders of their nests, swarming intruders in a flurry of beaks and claws. In the arena, trained war‑hawks and hunting falcons are prized for their speed and precision, striking to blind or disorient in a heartbeat.
