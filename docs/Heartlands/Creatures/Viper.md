# Viper

Vipers are sleek, venomous snakes known for their lightningâ€‘fast strikes and hinged fangs that deliver potent, often fatal toxins. Their patterned scales provide perfect camouflage among rocks, leaves, or desert sands, allowing them to lie in wait for unsuspecting prey. When threatened, they coil tightly, hissing with a sound that sends smaller creatures fleeing. In many cultures, vipers are symbols of danger and cunning, feared not only for their venom but for their patient, calculating nature.
