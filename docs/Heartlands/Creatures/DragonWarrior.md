# Dragon Warrior

Dragon Warriors are fearsome hybrids, their towering, humanoid forms clad in the scales, claws, and horns of their draconic lineage. Muscles coil beneath scale‑plated skin, and their eyes gleam with the cunning fire of their dragon kin. Each movement carries both the precision of a trained fighter and the raw, destructive power of a beast born for the skies. Capable of breathing gouts of flame—or in rare cases, frost or lightning—they wield massive weapons with ease, often forged from the bones and scales of ancient dragons.
