# Snail

Snails are slow‑moving, soft‑bodied creatures protected by coiled, hardened shells. They thrive in damp forests, gardens, and marshlands, feeding on leaves, fungi, and decaying plants. Though harmless to most, their slime trails can make paths dangerously slick, and some larger species develop shells as tough as stone.
