# Spiders

Spiders are agile, patient predators, spinning intricate webs or stalking the ground in search of prey. Their many eyes gleam in the dark, and their venom varies from merely irritating to instantly deadly.

Large, fast, and relentless, Wolf Spiders hunt without webs, chasing prey across the forest floor. Their sharp fangs inject a paralyzing venom, and their speed allows them to overwhelm targets before they can escape.

Sleek and deadly, Black Widows spin tangled webs in dark corners, lying in wait for prey to stumble into their silken traps. Their venom is dangerously potent, capable of felling even larger creatures within minutes.

Towering over lesser spiders, Goliaths have thick, chitinous armor and fangs the size of daggers. They ambush from burrows or tree canopies, crushing their victims before dragging them into darkness to feed.

The Spider Queen is a monstrous fusion of woman and spider, her upper body regal yet twisted, her lower half an enormous arachnid form. She commands vast broods of spiders, weaving vast webbed domains and striking with both spellcraft and venom. Those ensnared in her silken halls rarely escape, their bodies wrapped and stored as offerings for her eternal hunger.
