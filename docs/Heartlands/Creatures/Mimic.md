# Mimic

Door Mimics are devious shapeshifters that disguise themselves as ordinary doors, patiently waiting for an unsuspecting victim to approach. The moment a hand reaches for the handle, the mimic’s surface splits into a gaping maw lined with jagged teeth, and adhesive tendrils lash out to ensnare prey. Their wooden‑like hides can perfectly imitate aged oak, polished mahogany, or even rusted iron, making them almost impossible to spot until it’s too late.

Book Mimics lure the curious by taking the form of ancient tomes, often adorned with ornate bindings or strange runes. When opened, the “pages” unfold into snapping jaws and grasping tongue‑like appendages, eager to pull the reader in. Some secrete a paralytic ink, rendering prey helpless while the mimic feeds. Scholars whisper of rare, intelligent Book Mimics that can speak and use their disguise to tempt victims with forbidden knowledge before devouring them.
