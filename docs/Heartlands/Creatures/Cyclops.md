# Cyclops

Cyclops are towering, one‑eyed giants whose immense strength is matched only by their stubborn will. Standing twice the height of a man, they wield tree‑sized clubs or massive stone hammers with bone‑shattering force. Their single eye grants them uncanny focus and depth of sight, allowing them to hurl boulders with deadly precision. While often solitary and territorial, some are cunning enough to demand tribute from travelers or guard hidden mountain passes for coin—or for sport.
