# Cattle

Cattle are sturdy, even‑tempered herd animals kept for their meat, milk, hides, and strength as draft beasts. Grazing in open pastures or along the edges of farmland, they are a vital source of sustenance and trade for villages and cities alike. While generally docile, a startled or protective bull can be dangerously aggressive, lowering its head and charging with bone‑shaking force. In many rural traditions, cattle are symbols of prosperity and endurance, their horns sometimes carved into ceremonial instruments or protective charms.
