# Shackles

Shackles are twisted, spectral jailers bound in rusted chains and fragments of broken manacles that rattle with every step. Their gaunt, unnatural forms seem half‑corporeal, flickering between shadow and substance as they move. Shackles stalk their prey with slow, deliberate menace before lashing out with barbed chains that coil around limbs, dragging victims into their cold, crushing embrace. Those ensnared feel their strength drained away, as if the weight of a lifetime’s sins were pressing upon them.
