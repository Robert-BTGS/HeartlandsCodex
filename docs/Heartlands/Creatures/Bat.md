# Bat


Bats are winged denizens of the night, their membranous wings stretch over elongated, claw tipped fingers. Their eyes gleam in the moonlight with eerie intelligence, their high pitched cries rippling through the darkness. They navigate the blackest caves and midnight skies, through ecoholocation, sensin the world in ways no mortal eye can see. 

While many feast on swarming insects or the sweet nectar of night blooming flowers, darker breeds thirst for blood, descendin in silent swarms to drain their prey. 

Described in folklore as the harbingers of curses and companions to witches or vampires, bats are a symbol of dread as they are creatures of the natural world
