# Twig People

Skinny Twigkin are wiry, brittle‑limbed forest sprites made from gnarled twigs and bark. Their spindly frames allow them to slip through undergrowth unseen, striking with thorny claws or small, sharpened sticks. They often act as scouts and skirmishers, harassing intruders before vanishing into the trees. Their bodies creak and snap as they move, the sound often mistaken for nothing more than wind in the branches—until it’s too late.

Round Twigkin are squat, knotted creatures resembling bundles of brambles and roots. Their thicker frames make them sturdier than their slender kin, capable of bashing foes with heavy, club‑like limbs. They tend to serve as defenders for Twigkin groves, standing their ground while the skinnier ones dart in and out to harry enemies. When still, they can easily be mistaken for a simple heap of forest debris, springing to life only when prey wanders too close.
