# Cave Troll

Cave Trolls are hulking, dim‑witted brutes that dwell in the deepest caverns and shadowed mountain passes. Their thick, stone‑gray hides are as tough as granite, shrugging off all but the heaviest blows, while their immense strength allows them to crush boulders—and bones—with ease. Though slow of thought, they are relentless once roused to anger, pursuing prey with single‑minded fury. Many wield crude clubs made from fallen timbers or jagged rock, using them to devastating effect in both ambushes and open combat. Legends claim that some cave trolls can heal from almost any wound, their bodies knitting back together so long as they remain in darkness.
