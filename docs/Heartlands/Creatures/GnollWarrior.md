# Gnoll Warrior

Gnoll Warriors are savage, hyena‑headed brutes driven by bloodlust and the thrill of the hunt. Their wiry, muscular bodies are built for speed and brutality, with claws and fangs that tear through flesh as easily as their crude, bone‑and‑iron weapons. They fight in chaotic packs, overwhelming enemies with relentless assaults and ear‑splitting, cackling war cries that unnerve even seasoned soldiers. In battle, a Gnoll Warrior shows little fear, striking with reckless ferocity until either they or their prey lies dead. Tribal scars and ritual markings often cover their hides, each one a testament to kills claimed and victories won.
