# Camel

Camels are the stalwart ships of the desert, their long legs and padded feet carrying them effortlessly across shifting dunes. Their humps hold precious reserves, allowing them to endure searing heat, biting cold, and long stretches without water. Calm and deliberate by nature, they are loyal to those who treat them well, yet quick to spit, bite, or kick when provoked. In the arena, warâ€‘camels are towering, intimidating mounts, their steady gait and unshakable endurance making them as dangerous in prolonged battles as they are in sudden, crushing charges.
