# Deer

Deer are swift, graceful herbivores that roam forests, meadows, and highland glades. Their keen hearing and sharp instincts allow them to vanish into the trees at the first hint of danger, making them a challenge for hunters. Bucks grow impressive antlers, used both in displays of dominance and in fierce battles during the rut. In many cultures, deer are symbols of purity, renewal, and the untamed spirit of the wild. Rare white stags are said to be messengers of the gods, appearing only to those destined for great journeys.
