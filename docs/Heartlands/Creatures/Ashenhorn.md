# Ashenhorn


These towering, nightmarish humanoid beasts have gaunt frames, leathery ash-brown skin, and elongated claws that give them a feral, almost demonic presence. A jagged obsidian horn juts from its head, framing a snarling maw filled with jagged teeth. A ragged mane of coarse hair runs along its back, accentuating its savage silhouette. Crude armor, shackles, and chains cling to its limbs, hinting that it was once bound — or perhaps unleashed — from captivity.

Known in dark legends as a relentless hunter, the Ashenhorn is feared not only for its brutal strength and speed, but for the way it stalks its prey with crude intelligence.
