# Golem

Stone Golems are towering constructs carved from unyielding rock and bound by ancient magic. Slow but unstoppable, they crush foes beneath their immense weight and pulverize obstacles with single, devastating blows. Their bodies are etched with faint runes that glow when their creators’ commands stir them to life.

Lava Golems are living furnaces of molten stone, their cracked, obsidian hides glowing with the heat of the magma that flows within. Every strike sends searing shards flying, and their touch can set armor smoldering. They leave scorched footprints in their wake, and the air around them shimmers with intense heat.

Iron Golems are forged from blackened steel and powered by the will of master smith‑mages. Their bodies are near‑impervious to weapons, and their blows land with the force of a battering ram. When roused to battle, they release bursts of steam and sparks, announcing each crushing strike.

Boulder Golems are crude but powerful constructs made from massive, uneven stones lashed together by vines of living moss and earth magic. Though clumsy in form, their heavy limbs can shatter walls and send foes flying. Fragments of their bodies often break off during combat, only to reassemble moments later as if nothing happened.
