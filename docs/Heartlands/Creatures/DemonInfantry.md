# Demon Infantry

Demon Infantry are the searing heart of the infernal legions, their dark red, fireâ€‘veined skin seeming to pulse with the heat of living magma. Their bodies are all muscle and sinew, built for relentless combat, with claws and jagged teeth serving as their only weapons. Flames flicker faintly beneath their skin, glowing brighter with each surge of rage, and their molten eyes lock onto prey with unyielding focus. 

They fight in brutal, frenzied packs, tearing through ranks with raw strength and savage precision. Wherever they march, the ground is left scorched and cracked, as if the fires of the underworld had clawed their way to the surface.
