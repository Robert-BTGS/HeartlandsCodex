# Plant Monster

Bloomstalkers are carnivorous plant beasts that lure prey with the vibrant, jewel‑like buds and flowers coiled around their tall, twisting stalks. Their broad leaves hide thorned tendrils capable of lashing out with whip‑like speed, pulling victims toward the plant’s central, sealed bud—where rows of hidden, petal‑lined teeth wait to consume them whole. The twisting vine body is strong enough to crush bone, and its surface glistens with a faint, sweet‑smelling sap that masks the creature’s true danger. Bloomstalkers thrive in humid jungles and enchanted groves, often rooted near water sources to ambush creatures that come to drink.
