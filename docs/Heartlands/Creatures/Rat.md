# Rat

Rats are small, quick, and highly adaptable scavengers found in cities, sewers, forests, and farmlands alike. Their sharp teeth and relentless appetites drive them to gnaw through wood, rope, and even thin metal in search of food. Living in large colonies, rats can quickly overrun an area, spreading disease and spoiling supplies. While often dismissed as pests, their cunning, survival instincts, and sheer numbers make them a persistent threatâ€”especially when hunger drives them to swarm.
