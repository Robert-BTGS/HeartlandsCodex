# Skeletons

Skeletons are the reanimated remains of the dead, bound to unholy magic or cursed duty. Their empty eye sockets glow with pale, unnatural light, and their brittle bones move with eerie precision.

Skeleton Archers are the undead marksman that weild ancient, splintered bows and quivers of black-fletched arrows. 

Skeleton Footmen however are armed with dented shields and rusted blades. They march in grim formations, their clattering bones achoing across the battlefield. 

Skeleton Gentlemen, better known as Gents, retai fragments of their former refinement. Dressed in decayed finery, they wield elegant walking sticks with surprising precision. 

Skeleton Sorcerers channel the dark magic that animates them, hurling necrotic blasts, summoning fresh undead from the bones of the fallen. 

Skeleton Warlords are massive and heavily armored, commaning lesser undead with guttural human roars. 

Skeleton Knights, clad in corroded plate and mounted upon equally undead steeds, thunder into battle with lance and sword.
