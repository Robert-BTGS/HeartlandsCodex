# Minotaur

Minotaurs are towering, bull‑headed warriors whose immense strength and relentless ferocity make them fearsome opponents. Their muscular frames are built for brutal close combat, and they wield massive axes, hammers, or clubs with devastating force. Minotaurs are known for their unyielding determination—once they lock onto prey, they charge with unstoppable momentum, crushing anything in their path. In many cultures, they are said to be guardians of labyrinths, using their cunning and intimate knowledge of twisting corridors to hunt intruders like cornered prey.
