# Enemy Goblin

Squat, sharp‑eared tricksters with leathery green skin and wide, grinning mouths full of uneven teeth. Though small in stature, they are quick, resourceful, and endlessly mischievous, turning whatever scraps they can find into crude weapons or clever traps. Goblins thrive in chaos, overwhelming enemies with noise, smoke, and sheer unpredictability. 

Their bulbous eyes gleam with cunning, and their high‑pitched laughter often echoes through the dark just before they strike. In the arena, they dart and weave around larger foes, taunting relentlessly until an opening appears—then swarming with wild, gleeful savagery.
