# Worm

Worms are soft‑bodied burrowers that thrive in soil, leaf litter, and damp, shadowed places. Though harmless to most creatures, they play a vital role in the land’s cycle, breaking down decay and enriching the earth. Their slow, steady movement allows them to tunnel unseen, leaving behind twisting passages that aerate the ground.
