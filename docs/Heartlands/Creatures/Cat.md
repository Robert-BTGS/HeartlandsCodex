# Cat

Cats are nimble, sharp‑eyed hunters, moving with silent grace whether stalking prey in alley shadows or lazing in sun‑warmed windowsills. Their keen senses and quick reflexes make them natural predators, capable of striking with lightning speed when threatened. In many cultures, cats are seen as omens—black‑furred bringing mystery, white‑furred bringing luck, and striped tabbies said to walk between the realms of the living and the dead. 

Among the more well‑known felines is Paul, the soot‑dusted companion of Maergrim the undercroft blacksmith, often found curled atop the forge or watching customers with a knowing, unblinking stare.
