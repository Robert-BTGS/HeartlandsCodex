# Bear
Brown Bear: Hulking lords of the forest, their massive forms cloaked in thick, eart-colored fur that ripples with muscles beneath. Though often solitary and deliberate in their movements, a brown bears charge is a thunderous explosionm of power. With claws as long as a mans hand and a roar that can shake leaves from the trees,they command respect and fear from all who wander their domain. 

Some legends tell of bears so ancient and wise that moss grows along their backs and their eyes burn with the golden fire of the sun. 

Grizzly Bear: Fearsome titans of the wild, their hulking frames draped in thick fur that bristles like a the pelt of a storm cloud. Standinfg on their hind legs, they tower over most creatures, eyes glinting with primal, unwavering resolve. Each swipe of their massive claws can shatter bone, with their thunderous roars echoing through valleys like the call of an anciet guardian. 

Some say the greatest of them bear silver scars from battles with frost giants, and their spirits roam the wilds long after their bodies have returned to earth.
