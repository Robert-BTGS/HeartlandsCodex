# Moon Shadow

Moonshadows are elusive, otherworldly hunters cloaked in darkness and silver light. Their sleek forms seem to blur at the edges, as if part of them exists just beyond the mortal realm. Under moonlight, their eyes gleam like pale orbs, and their movements become almost impossibly fastâ€”striking and vanishing before prey can react. Moonshadows are silent stalkers, able to slip through cracks, melt into shadows, and pass unseen even in open spaces. Folklore claims they are born from the union of night spirits and lunar magic, and that those who see one in its true form are fated to dream of it until the day it comes to claim them.
