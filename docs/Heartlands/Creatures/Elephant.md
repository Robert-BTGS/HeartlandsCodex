# Elephant

Elephants are towering, intelligent giants of the savanna and jungle, their thick gray hides and sweeping tusks making them both awe‑inspiring and formidable. Known for their deep familial bonds and uncanny memory, they travel in close‑knit herds, guided by wise matriarchs who remember ancient migration paths. In peaceful lands, elephants serve as powerful beasts of burden, capable of carrying massive loads or tearing down obstacles with ease.
