# Goblin

Cave Goblins are wiry, sharp‑eyed scavengers who make their homes in the dark recesses of mountains and deep underground tunnels. Their mottled green‑gray skin helps them vanish into shadow, while their oversized eyes grant them keen vision in the pitch black. Preferring ambush over open combat, they attack with crude clubs, jagged blades, or whatever they can scavenge, retreating into the labyrinth of their caves when the fight turns against them. Cave Goblins are notorious for setting traps—pitfalls, snare ropes, and rockslides—to weaken prey before closing in for the kill.

Forest Goblins are swift and cunning hunters who thrive beneath dense canopies and among tangled roots. Their green skin and lean frames allow them to melt into foliage, striking with wickedly curved blades or poison‑tipped arrows. Fiercely territorial, they defend their woodland homes in coordinated packs, using the terrain to their advantage—climbing trees, leaping between branches, and vanishing into undergrowth before an enemy can strike back. Forest Goblins are known to tame giant spiders or wild wolves, unleashing them upon trespassers to sow panic and chaos.
