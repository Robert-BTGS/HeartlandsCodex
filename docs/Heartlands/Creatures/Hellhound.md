# Hellhound

Hellhounds are fearsome, infernal beasts wreathed in the stench of brimstone, their eyes glowing with a malevolent red light. Their dark, sinewy hides are marred with bone‑like spines jutting from their backs, and their snarling maws reveal fangs that burn with unnatural heat. Born of the lower planes, hellhounds are relentless hunters, able to track prey by scent across any terrain—and even through the veil between worlds. Their bite can sear flesh, while their guttural growls echo like distant thunder. Legends claim they are the chosen hounds of demon lords, loosed to punish oathbreakers and drag the damned into the fires below.
