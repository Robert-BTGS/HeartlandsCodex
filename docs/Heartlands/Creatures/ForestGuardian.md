# Forest Guardian

Forest Guardians are towering, tree‑like warriors born from the ancient magic of the wilds. Their bark‑covered bodies are as hard as seasoned oak, and their limbs move with the slow, deliberate strength of deep roots breaking stone. Moss drapes their shoulders, vines coil around their arms, and their eyes glow with the green fire of nature’s will. They stand watch over sacred groves, striking down intruders with sweeping branch‑limbs or hurling boulders wrenched from the earth.
