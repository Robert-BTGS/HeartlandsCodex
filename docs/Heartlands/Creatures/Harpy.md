# Harpy

Harpies are vicious, winged predators with the body of a bird of prey and the upper form of a twisted, wild‑eyed woman. Their talons are razor‑sharp, capable of rending flesh in an instant, while their long, feathered wings carry them in swift, diving strikes from above. Harpies hunt in flocks, using ear‑piercing screeches to disorient prey before dragging it into the air or tearing it apart on the ground. They are drawn to high cliffs and jagged peaks, where their nests of bones and feathers overlook the lands they terrorize. In dark folklore, harpies are said to be cursed spirits of the envious, doomed to hunger eternally for the lives they can never reclaim.
